# Random Forest Regression Model
This folder contains the final trained model for predicting flight prices.

The model is saved in Pickle format inside the zipped file found [here](https://github.com/MeshalAlamr/flight-price-prediction/blob/main/model/rf_flight_prediction.zip).


### Model scores:
| Metric | Score |
|:---|:---:|
| Precision | 0.82 |
| Recall | 0.63 |
| F1 | 0.71 |
| Accuracy | 0.89 |

Therefore, the model is able to predict flight ticket prices within around  â‰ˆ $61.87.
